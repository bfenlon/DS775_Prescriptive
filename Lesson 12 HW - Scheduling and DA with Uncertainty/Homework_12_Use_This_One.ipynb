Use these estimates and the solution to this problem from Lesson 3 to construct and solve a single Pyomo model to determine the optimal schedule that takes the minimal amount of time. \n",

    "Clearly dealing with artifacts can be very costly for Reliable Construction.  It is known from past experience that about 30% of building sites in this area contain special artifacts.  Fortunately, they can purchase an insurance policy - a quite expensive insurance policy. The insurance policy costs \\$500000 (\\$.5 million), but it covers all fines and penalities for delays in the event that special artifacts are found that require remediation. Effectively, this means that Reliable could expect the same profit they would get without insurance (minus the cost of the policy).\n",
